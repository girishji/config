For Docker installation, however, you’ll need to use Homebrew Cask.

“What’s Homebrew Cask, and why can’t I install Docker with brew install docker?” you might ask. Let’s clarify…

If you have ever installed any GUI software on Mac the “standard way,” you probably know that it normally requires downloading the package, opening it, and installing by the drag-and-drop method to the Application folder. Homebrew, by default, can only install command-line tools.

Homebrew Cask is a Homebrew extension for installing GUI software on Mac. It means that instead of the standard download and drag-and-drop process, you can use this.

brew cask install [gui_tool]
