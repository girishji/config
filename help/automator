How to edit already saved "quick action" or "service" menus:
For quick actions: right click on folder in Finder, to to "quick actions",
  go to "customize". In the new window right click on the specific quick
  action and "open in finder". Then open that file using "automator".

see http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/index_files/create-your-own-epub-ebook-files-using-automator.php for example
very useful for pdf compression etc.
- start with a dialog that asks you to choose app, service etc.
- if you don't see empty right hand box then you are editing existing service
- drag stuff from left to write
- set options in dragged stuff and save
- you can lik actions to select only certain file extension, or reveal in finder after result file is done
- you can click options inside action to open a dialog (ex. select level of compression)
- you can create application, service, etc (when you select it'll tell you what they are)

to test:
- best to test inside automator
- add a temporary action at top called 'get specified finder items' or appropriate one, just to get input (remove this after test is done!)
- click 'run' at top and see 'results' window in the actions (click the button)
