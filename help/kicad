PCB editor:
right click -> special tools -> has (move exact, create array, etc).

--
run DRC (design rule checker) from pcb editor (inspect->design rule check)
if it says some silkscreen violation, move that text 
make sure your filled zones are not islands

--

filling zones (for ground). use B.Cu layer. make sure ground from processor
connected to a pad or that it is connected to copper island through a via.
only then will pour succeed.

--

pcb editor does not update footprints if you edit them separately. This
is a bug. To mitigate, go to schematic editor, assign symbol to something
else (temporarily), generate pcb in pcb editor, go back to schematic editor and assign
symbol to what was before and generate pcb.

--

pcbnew is a standalone executable also. it has different menu and you
use this for paneling. when invoked from within kicad launcher it
works within 'project' context and links with schematic editor.

--

Move with Reference (right click->special tools) is very useful. Always
adjust the grid size on tool row at the top.

--

In pcbeditor use tools->update footprint from library
