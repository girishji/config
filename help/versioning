Pessimistic versioning branches
Dim adheres to semantic versioning, meaning it'll try to keep backwards compatibility in minor and patch releases. In short:

A breaking change will bump the major version number (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
An added feature will bump the minor version number (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
A bug fix will bump the patch version number (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
Since Vim's plugin manager doesn't allow specifying version ranges, Dim provides "pessimistic versioning branches" itself to allow users to lock to a specific version range:

The branch named 1.x is updated for every released version in the 1.x range (~> 1.0 or >= 1.0.0 and < 2.0.0)
The branch named 1.1 is updated for every released version in the 1.1.x range (~> 1.1.0 or >= 1.1.0 and < 1.2.0)
