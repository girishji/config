cantin@sodium:~> ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/cantin/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/cantin/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/cantin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
f6:61:a8:27:35:cf:4c:6d:13:22:70:cf:4c:c8:a0:23 cantin@sodium
The command ssh-keygen -t rsa initiated the creation of the key pair.

No passphrase was entered (Enter key was pressed instead).

The private key was saved in .ssh/id_rsa. This file is read-only and only for you. No one else must see the content of that file, as it is used to decrypt all correspondence encrypted with the public key.

The public key is save in .ssh/id_rsa.pub.

In this case, the content of file id_rsa.pub is

ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEArkwv9X8eTVK4F7pMlSt45pWoiakFkZMw
G9BjydOJPGH0RFNAy1QqIWBGWv7vS5K2tr+EEO+F8WL2Y/jK4ZkUoQgoi+n7DWQVOHsR

WQM= cantin@sodium
It is one line in length.

Its content is then copied in file .ssh/authorized_keys of the system you wish to SSH to without being prompted for a password.
