How to quickly navigate between files and folder in Finder window (or Finder like window when
you try to open a file from another app)

Cmd-up arrow : go up one folder
Right arrow : to go down folder that is highlighted
Any key : to highlight a folder starting with that letter (this is very useful)

gp->help->vscode do all the way up (cmd + up arrow), then 'g', then 'h', then 'v'

DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO SIDE BAR where folder shortcut are pinned.

by crontab but by launchd. To remove:

> launchctl remove 'whatever got listed above'

> remove plist files corresponding to adobe
do the same from /Library/LaunchAgents
