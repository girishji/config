you can list all highlighted notes by picking 'notes' on your app. You can email that stuff, and then cut and paste to anything else

====

you can read pdf books by emailing to kindle address. mobi works best (no conversion needed)

to read pdf, you have to convert to mobi or azf format. Let kindle convert. Send mail to kindle address (each device has
email address, see https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html/ref=kinw_myk_surl_1#/home/content/pdocs/dateDsc/)
