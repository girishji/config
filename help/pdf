To export text annotations (your comments) use skim:

On OS X, I've downloaded Skim. I can open an copy of a pdf annotated in Preview or GoodReader, then convert the annotations to .skim format by selecting file>convert notes. Having done this, I can select file>export and there's an option to export notes as a txt file.

To change any PDF:
1) open it in Nuance pdf tool in parallels
2) export to Word, make changes, then save as pdf.
