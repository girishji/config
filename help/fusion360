To zoom, put mouse pointer to where you want zoomed and then rotate scro wheel
(or pinch)

To align bodies around cylinder, construct plane tangent to cylinder,
  extrude a cube on this plane, create a plane tangent to the circle
  amd align bodies on this plane (see align icon). Then
  rotate your bodies around the center of cylinder circle (see below).

To rotate bodies around anchor point, choose 'move (m)', then
  CLICK ON ANCHOR icon TWO timws (once after you choose point, and
  then you go back and click again). Now you can rotate.

Parametric modeling:
- only rigid joints permit parametric. Moves are not parametric.
so, create fake components (you can hide) and use offsets to
arrange other components. Joints can only be made on components
- To create parametric relation with a bunch of componets 
to one component, use 'rigid groups'. Bug: when you are creating
joint to a group (group), only one component in it
will become transparent, but don't worry, and finish the
joint creating process, rest of components in group
will snap into place
- You can also create a parametric sketch, extrude a body and
then rigid joint this component two other components
- you can do rigid joint to a sketch (should be within a component)
  to another compnent (face of component)

when line is blue it is not constrained. black lines are constrained.
