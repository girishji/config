to debug: use tjvries vlog file (github)
:messages  // shows log messages 
to get all 256 colors do :hilights (:hi)
first 16 colors are chosen  through iterm2 preferences, rest have fixed rgb.
do not enable termguicolors. this gives 24 big colors (much bigger palette)
than 256 that comes with cterm. theyare called 'gui' colors, as in guibg
guifg etc. as opposed to ctermbg, ctermfg, etc.
:lua =vim.api.nvim_get_hl_by_name("Normal", true)
prints gui colors of group 'Normal'. passing 'false' gives cterm colors.
in vimscript, same would be :echo synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("DevIconTwig")), "fg")

nvim stores data in ~/.local/share/nvim/
plugins are also stored in there under pack/packer...
