VS code:
fn-page up work, but not 'page up'.

jupyter multiple outputs:
from IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell
InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = "all"
or
use display(foo) multiple times

Cmd-C to copy full line when no word is selected. Since ctrl-y does not work, you can use this

Control+enter to stay inside but execute jupyter cell. otherwise shift+enter.

jupyter:

Shit+tab+tab to get documentataion drop down window (very useful)

control shift - => to split cell

In jupyter, put a ";" at end of last line if you
want to display picture without extra line (that prints the object)
otherwise you have to do a plt.show() or something.

--

intellisense:

Press Ctrl-Space will dismiss the popup
Pressing Tab or Enter will insert the selected member.

ctrl space: for widget that suggests in intellisense.
to get more info, scroll down to the function it displays
and press ctrl+space again
