IMPORTANT: awk is a superset of grep and sed is an editor you would use to substitute pattern etc.
====
awk '/xxx/' file // same as grep xxx file
awk '/regexp/ {print}' // same as above
----
git status |gr src |awk '{print $2}'
--

sed -e '...' -e '...'
----
to print a matching string:
example:
cat foo |sed -n '/.*\.o/ s/.* \(.*\.o\) .*/\1/p'
prints word xxx/yyy/sss.o contained in a line. .*\.o\ is the pattern I am after.
The \( , \) and \1 are the key. The \1 represents and print that what is found between the \( and \) in the searchstring.
