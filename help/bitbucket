Make a commit and push the change
Learn the Git basics of stage, commit, push when you make a change to the 'sample.html' file.
Go to your terminal window and navigate to the repository root.
Using your favorite editor, edit the sample.html file.
Change the heading from My First File to Playing in the Sand.
Save and close the file.
Stage the file with Git.
git add sample.html
Commit the change.
git commit -m "changing sample.html"
Push to Bitbucket.
git push
The system prompts you for a username/password.
Enter your Bitbucket account name and the password.
After the push completes, click Commits, in Bitbucket, to view your change.
The 'git add' moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a set of changes (a snapshot) before committing it to the official history.
Git add command
The git commit takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.
Git commit
Pushing lets you move a local branch or series of commits to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single changeset.
