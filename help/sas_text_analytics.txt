SAS Viya visual text analytics user's guide:

click on a node and select "open" to see what is going on.

SAS Visual Text Analytics requires you to designate a single character variable as a text variable, which is then used for textual analysis. You can also designate variables as category variables, which are used for categorical modeling of your textual data.
The category variable ("newsgroup" here is displayed in Category node).

Although predefined concepts are useful for identifying general concepts present in your document collection, custom concepts can be used to further enhance a concepts model. For example, suppose that out of all of the matches returned for the predefined concept nlpOrganization, you want to extract only news articles that mention college names. 

topics == clustering of concepts; documents are associated with these cluster. Can a document belong to >1 topic? yes (A single document can contain more than one topic.
The interactive window for the Topics node displays all the topics that SAS Visual Text Analytics identified. The default name of a topic is the top five terms that appear frequently in the topic. These terms are sorted in descending order based on their weight.)

You can create a topic from a term (from the node->open)

When you select a topic and see all the matching terms in a document. you see a lot more terms. Remember only first 5 terms are shown in the label of a topic.

concept == meaningful collection of terms (documents that mention college or university). There are some predefined concepts. 

term == building block of concept or synonym list (ex. "college", "clarkson university"). they have a "role" (say part-of-speech)

category == can a doc belong to >1 category? 
you have a category variable displayed and its values
sum of all matched vategories was < total num of docs
you can write rule and test a sample text

Data tab of project:

Diplay variable (checkbox when you are selecting variables for analysis):
Display variables become columns in the Documents tab of all pipeline nodes with the exception of the Data node and Sentiment node. To change the display status of variables, click the check box to the left of each variable that you want to modify.

Save to exchange: click on 3 dots on pipeline pane

concept :

Matching documents are shown only for concepts with the concept behavior set to Primary. Concepts with the concept behavior set to Supporting will not yield any matching documents. In order to change the concept behavior from Primary to Supporting for a custom concept, right-click the custom concept and select Set concept behavior รฐ Supporting.

REMOVE_ITEM 
Allows removal of a match from one concept when the same match is found in another concept, 
string, or in a specified context. The ALIGNED operator is required and signifies that the match 
in the first argument must be exactly the same as in the second argument. Also, the first argument 
must include a concept name with a _c{} modifier. 

REMOVE_ITEM:(ALIGNED, "<element-1> _c{concept-name}", "<element-2> element-3") 

where element can be a string, concept name, part-of-speech tag, or special symbol. 

For example: 

REMOVE_ITEM:(ALIGNED, "_c{currEmployees}", "retiredEmployees") 

removes the matches from a current employees list, as defined in currEmployees, 
that represent retired employees, as defined in retiredEmployees. This rule 
cleans up the first list and makes it valid.

ALIGNED 
Takes two arguments. Produces a match when both arguments are matched in the same span of text 
(aligned) in a document. Used with the REMOVE_ITEM rule type only. For example, the following 
rule specifies that if a match on the myLoc concept also matches the PersonName concept, then the 
match in myLoc should be removed: 

REMOVE_ITEM:(ALIGNED,"_c{myLoc}","PersonName")
