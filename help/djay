djay pro

Precue:
0) you don’t need 4 decks, next to each song is a small 3 bar icon, click it and it plays only through headphones; then click cmd-enter to add to que
1) configure audio device by Window->Pre-Cuing
2) have 4 decks (click on 4 vertical bars on right top corner)
3) load song on deck 4 (decks 2 and 3 are for automix). play it. click on headphone icon just below deck
4) 2nd icon on top left corner is precue. use it to control volume.
5) reduce volume of precue deck to 0, so you only hear from headphone. volume slider is next to waveform 
6) can precue using bluetooth headphones (bose sound link works also)

Automix:
1) left hand bottom corner is automix button. select playlist first, then click on this icon and start.
2) to have a list for automix, click on que icon (2nd from end) on right bottom corner. to this load songs. (cmd+return to add, backspace to delete). Click on auto mix icon (2nd one left bottom corner), select “none” to point to the que (and not from any iTunes playlist). 
3) See how serato pyro (iPhone) mixes; it looks at the waveform and it matches waveform ups and downs (intensity) by advancing next track a little and then it transitions. You do this by clicking on next song’s waveform at the top (below the title of song), and then hit arrow picture (dulled out even though it is functional) next to the slider in the middle that switches from one deck to another. Key is not to give pause between songs so people keep dancing for a while. With this you have power to transition whenever you want.
4) Set end point of song: Deck 1 ->cue points->set end point (alt-T for left deck, alt-Y for right one); this way song transitions out leaving ‘gap’ between songs. This is equal to ‘fade out’ cue point in tractor. To remove end point, choose ‘reset cue points’ from above menu. You cannot set start point but you can move the cursor on the passive deck to wherever you want next song to start.

- to enable microphone (it is broken in this release though) click on top left corner microphone icon (3rd from left, all the way at top). Enable by clicking on button inside the dropdown.

- Master volume is at top left corner, all the way at the top; Deck volume buttons are to the left of left deck and right of right deck

- Expand library: click on icon at right bottom corner (last icon)


- Effects:
In waveform mode, you see a small rectangular box with arrow on left side of waveform. slide the slider to right to reveal Fx. Once this is revealed, center icon is ‘repeat’. ‘In’ and “out” (when “manual” is selected)refers to selecting the segment to repeat.
There is also “cue” icon next to “repeat”. If you click on a button to set cue point (there are 8 cue point options), click again to start the cue.
Under “FX” you’ll see predefined effects (some need to be paid). Click “ON” next to them to start them. “Flanger” is good.

- More Effects: click on the grid like button in the top middle, just below red record button

- Simplest way to set cue is to use “Set” and point looking buttons below waveform. 

- can’t pause b/w songs. go to automix settings, set to 0 sec when transition starts.


- Help->keyboard shortcuts

- Bluetooth headphones: Pair it and djay should it. Otherwise, for microphone, open microphone icon (top left) and select ‘configure audio devices’. Set microphone to SBH50 (sony) there. When you need to you the microphone 1) step away to avoid echo, 2) turn on slider inside microphone dropdown window (top left), and talk. If audio sounds bad (for precuing), open microphone window, and select ‘configure audio devices’, switch microphone back to built-in microphone. When you are done, turn off bluetooth headset, and always carry a USB stick charger. To pair the device, turn on bluetooth on laptop, hold power button on SBH50 for many seconds until bluetooth icon appears, now it is discoverable.
