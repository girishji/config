# do not do 'qmk setup' or don't let it clone official repository
# into local machine. fork first (fork happens only on github end, while
# cloning happens on local machine). clone this fork. create a branch off this
# cloned fork (recommended) and commit to it. issue pull requests to merge your
# changes upstream and occassionally sync your fork with official repository
# (can do it on web).
