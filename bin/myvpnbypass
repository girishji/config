# before connecting to vpn:
# first find default gateway. do 'netstat -rn' at the top look for en0 interface and gw. note this.
# 
# after connecting to vpn:
# - find out ip addr of sip.brocade.com (lync server). Ping it and it prints. (144.49.138.17)
# - add route for this ip to go through previous default gw (after vpn, there will be new gw in tun)
# sudo route add -host 144.49.138.17 10.100.148.1
# (don't use -net as that would indicate network and you need to provide netmask)
# - say previous default gw was 10.100.148.1. Add a route for this to go through en0 (instead of tun)
# sudo route add -host 10.100.148.1 -interface en0

# on mac en0 appears to be wifi, en4 is ethernet
# NOTE: above route add commands associate tun0 with the new routes you added (if vpn is connected), and therefore problem persists. 
#     You want to associate en0 or en4 with new route and gateway you added. So disconnect from vpn, do route add,
#     and then connect back to vpn.

# email started giving problems again within vpn
# email.brocade.com (144.49.210.51), bypass this
